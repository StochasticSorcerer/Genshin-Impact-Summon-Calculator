# Genshin Impact Summon Calculator

I coded the Genshin Impact summoning mechanism into R and used the Monte Carlo method to simulate summons. This was implemented into a Shiny application to allow users to input their own parameters such as amount of simulations, amount of summons, current pity, whether the last 5 star summoned was a featured unit, and the amount of the featured 5 star the user wants. The app displays probabilities, expected values, and graphs to give a better understanding of the risk involved with summoning at the users current parameters.
